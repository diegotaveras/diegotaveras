- 👋 Hi, I’m @diegotaveras, studying Computer Science as a freshman from Puerto Rico at UIUC!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming challenges, cybersecurity, ML and just learning about coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin, though I know a bit of Python and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me learn more about code.
